# fresh

`fresh` is a standalone coding-agent harness based on the Pi agent harness,
with native FreshCtx context freshness built in. It is developed privately;
it shares Pi's architecture and most of its code, but it is its own thing:
own repo, own binary (`fresh`), own config scope (`.fresh/`, `~/.fresh/`,
`FRESH_*` env vars), and strict verified context preparation on every model
request. See [FRESH.md](FRESH.md) for install, run, and configuration.

Upstream: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi, pinned at
`9767ba275f3e9a5ee0f5c5342249b629ab1b2282` for this fork. Internal npm package
names (`@earendil-works/*`) are intentionally unchanged for merge compatibility.

* **[@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent](packages/coding-agent)**: Interactive coding agent CLI (ships as `fresh`)
* **[@earendil-works/pi-agent-core](packages/agent)**: Agent runtime with tool calling and state management
* **[@earendil-works/pi-ai](packages/ai)**: Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, …)

To learn more about the upstream project:

* [Visit pi.dev](https://pi.dev), the project website with demos
* [Read the documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest), but you can also ask the agent to explain itself

## Permissions & Containerization

`fresh` does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox it. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns (written for `pi`; substitute the `fresh` binary):

- **Gondolin extension**: keep the agent and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build         # Refresh model data, then build all packages
npm run build:offline # Rebuild using existing model data without network access
npm run check         # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
```
